# Deeplearning For NLP

Here I explored the performance effect of different deeplearning approaches to text-classification - Cnns, Rnns, and transformers. This was done for purely experimental purposes.

The main highlights of this projects involves building up code classes from scratch for Training, Tokenization, Label encoding etc solely with numpy and pytorch instead of using pre-built classes from hugging-face, tensorflow etc.

Explore more by looking at the notebooks.

The motivation to do this was from [Made with ML foundational coure](https://madewithml.com/courses/foundations/)
